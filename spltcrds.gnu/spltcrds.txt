SPLTCRDS - A Klondike Utility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The purpose of this tool is to split a cardset into component cards in one
of three file formats, these being IFF ILBM, BMP and RAW. RAW format is for
Klondike 95 devlopment purposes only at present, and is thus not documented.

Usage:
    spltcrds <filename> [/I | /B | /R]

Switches:
    /I   IFF ILBM format (default due to origin of Klondike)
    /B   BMP format (24-bit)
    /R   RAW format (24-bit)

The cards will be individual pictures named CARD00.LBM, CARD01.LBM, etc, or
CARD00.BMP, CARD01.BMP, etc, if output requested in BMP format or CARD00.RAW,
CARD01.RAW, etc, if output requested in RAW format.

NOTE: RKP format cardsets cannot be dumped as IFF, but it will let you try...
