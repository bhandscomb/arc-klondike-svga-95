CARDINFO - A Klondike Utility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The purpose of this tool is simply to display a little information about a
selected cardset - it just reads the card file's header and reports the number
of cards in the deck and the number of colours. Not bullet proof (no format
checking!)

Usage:
    cardinfo <filename>
