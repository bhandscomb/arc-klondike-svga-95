MQ
~~
    Usage: mq <queuename> <filename> [filename...]

Joins files compressed with CMPR to make a 'queue' file for use with the
installer, sending the start of file offsets to stdout so they can be put
into the INSTALL.CFG file.

If the argument after the queue name begins with '@', the filename after
the '@' is assumed to contain a list of file names, one per line, to use
instead of using names on the command line.
