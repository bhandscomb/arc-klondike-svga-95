The code has been written in a modular fashion, has is therefore in many
different pieces. There are, however, only three main classes of files that
make up the complete source. The "main" modules could be described as
application level, in that they say what is to be done and when. The
"support" modules could be described as kernel level, since they perform
most of the dirty work in the game. Finally, there are a few files that
act as glue to ensure all the different source files get along... :-)
